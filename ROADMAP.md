# LibreSpot Roadmap

Actionable work only. Historical and completed roadmap material is archived in CHANGELOG.md; blocked work is kept in Roadmap_Blocked.md.

## Actionable Items

## Remaining after 2026-08-21 evening audit

Highest ID: RD-106. Issue tracker: zero open issues/PRs; closed #1-#5 predate v4 and stay closed. Discussions #20 and #21 are operator announcements, not in-repo bugs.

Shipped this pass (deleted from this file): RD-78 search watermarks, RD-79 disabled rail contrast, RD-82 AtomicFile, RD-85 dead members, RD-87 LibreSpotPaths, RD-88 PowerShell host path, RD-89 DWM palette colors, RD-99 snapshot-error glyph, RD-100 screenshot contract, RD-101 WPF-UI template leak gate, RD-102 CycloneDX local tool, RD-103 changelog HEAD-only bullets, RD-104 Jump List labels. Filled/secondary/checkbox/combo disabled states now use DisabledTextBrush; CardListBoxItemStyle remains under RD-105. Bloom checklist/manifest decision drift (the RD-81 note) is aligned; the gh-pages gate below remains.

### P3

- [ ] P3 — RD-98: Areas this audit did not reach
  Why: Honest coverage so the next pass does not assume these were cleared.
  Where: LibreSpot.ps1 WinForms/WPF-in-PS GUI event flow and Module-* orchestration bodies; OperationJournalUndoService undo token execution beyond the CLI guard; Marketplace export/restore archive internals; AvalonEdit custom-patch editor runtime; Crowdin round-trip
  Fix: Focused pass per area; PS GUI flow and the undo executor have the most user-facing risk.
